# covariance-reaction-norms
Code, tutorial, and data files for estimating covariance reaction norm (CRN) models. After cloning the repository, working through the file `CRN-tutorial.pdf` will be helpful to get started. See Martin, J. S. (2023) for further details on CRN models. Please cite this paper appropriately for any applications or modifications of the code provided here. The data files in the meerkat analysis folder are modified from an openly available dataset published by Houslay and colleagues (2021). Any subsequent use of the provided data files should, therefore, also cite these authors as the original source.
