# covariance-reaction-norms
Code, tutorial, and data files for estimating covariance reaction norm (CRN) models. See Martin, J. S. (under review) for further details on CRN models. Please cite this paper appropriately for any applications or modifications of the code provided here. The data files in the meerkate analysis folder are modified from an openly available dataset published by Houslay and colleagues (2021). Any subsequent use of thes provided data files should, therefore, also cite these authors as the original source.
